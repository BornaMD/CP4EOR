# Data Lab currently is the most popular tool for DS

# Why we use python:
# Versatility, automation, Extensive support libraries, Great Corperate Sponsors, Connect into any datasources, Relatively easy to learn, Dynamic or Typed, OOP, Very active community. 
# They use M platform?
# Data visualization: Tableau, JupyterLab
# Engeneering tools: Spark, Scala, HTML, Javascript, Jupyterlab
# Machine Learning: Scikit learn, Tenserflow, 
# They use GitLab for there collaboration projects.
# Linear Algebra is a good addition for use in Programming models.
# Go lang and Rosetta are new languages coming up for connecting various codes. For now Python does this.
# To create a JupyterLab interface you need to code something in python to generate JS and HTML code.
# If it is an interface that already exists this is done very easily (copying code), and if you want something customized 
# In the US they are still using R, but Python is taking over quickly due to readability and speed.
